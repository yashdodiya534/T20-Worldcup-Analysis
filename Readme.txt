Now Let's understand the project step by step.

1. Situation:
Alien watch cricket Game and they like cricket.
They called Nickpuri the Chief of F.I.E.L.D. to surrender the earth otherwise they will destroy the earth.
After negotiation Nickpuri made a condition that if aliens defeat Team "Earth" in a cricket match then the earth is yours and if aliens lose the match then they have to work as interns in any company IT company.

2. Task:
We have to create such a Team that,
1. Team should be able to score at least 180 runs on average.
2. Alien should be defeated on 150 runs on average.

3. Action:
1. Data collection using web scraping from ESPN website.
2. Data cleaning and transformation in Python Pandas.
3. Data transformation in Power Query.
4. Data modeling and building parameters using DAX.
5. Build a Dashboard for openers, Middle-order batsmen, All-rounders, Finishers, and Fast bowlers.

Result:
Hopefully, This dashboard helps to take data-driven decisions in Team selection and Team "Earth" to defeat aliens.

Important Cricket Terminologies used in Dashboard:
1)Batting Average: Average runs scored in innings.
2)Strike Rate: No.of runs scored per 100 balls.
3)Innings Batted: Total innings Batted.
4)Boundary%: % Runs scored from the boundary.
4)Bowling Economy: Average run allowed per over
5)Bowlling Strike Rate: Average no.of balls need to take wickets
6)Bowling Average: No. of runs allowed per wickets
7)Dot ball% : % Dot balls bowled.

what I learned from the overall project:
1)How to collect data from any website using web scraping.
2)How to clean data in python pandas.
3)what are key points while designing your dashboards, like Dashboard Theme color, primary and secondary color, Font selection & size, and Aspect ratio for images.

Thank you Dhaval Patel Hemanand Vadivel for this beautiful End to End project.
we are expecting more and more such projects from codebasics.
